>  You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.



This document explains how the scripts and function work all together; what each of the functions accomplish; how the datasets are constructed in order to provide the solution; how the work can be replicated by going through the code.
