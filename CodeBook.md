# About the data
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

### Measurements
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The training data is located under the `train` folder and has been named `X_train.txt`. The test data is located under the `test` folder with the file named `X_test.txt` These files contain 561 variable names that were generated by the sensors.


### The sensors
There are two sensors from which the data is acquired: an __accelerometer__ and a __gyroscope__. Triaxal acceleration readings are collected from the accelerometer, while angular velocity in the tree axis are read from the gyroscope. Additionally these measurements are processed under two domains: time and frequency. All of these measurements total __561 variables__.

### Observations about the data frames for measurements 
From the short reports printed above, we can appreciate that both data frames `train` with 7352 observations, and `test` with 2947 observations, hold the same number of variables (561), which facilitates the merging operations later. The variable names are the default and are labeled as "Vnnn" where _nnn_ is the variable number from 1 through 561. Later, these variable names will be reassigned with the ones used by the researchers.


### Subjects and Activities
The experiments have been carried out with a group of `30 volunteers` within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (`WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING`) wearing a smartphone.



#### Subjects data frame for the `train` dataset
The `subjects` data frame is generated by reading the file `subject_name.txt`, where name could take either of two values: `train` or `test`. We will use this file naming convention in our advantage later by applying one common function to both data frames. Below is shown a short summary of `subjects` data frame.


```r
subject_train <- read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt") 
short_summary(subject_train)
```

```
Observations: 	 7352 			First variables: V1 
Variables: 	 1 			Last variables: V1 

First observations

```
       V1       
 Min.   : 1.00  
 1st Qu.: 8.00  
 Median :19.00  
 Mean   :17.41  
 3rd Qu.:26.00  
 Max.   :30.00  
```


```

Vector Class: integer
```

```
	Subject IDs: 1 3 5 6 7 8 11 14 15 16 17 19 21 22 23 25 26 27 28 29 30
```
Note that the subject IDs for the `train` data frame are not continuous from 1 through 30; some IDs are missing. These IDs will be found in the `test` data frame.



#### Subjects data frame for `test` dataset
The `subjects` data frame for `test` is generated by reading the file `subject_test.txt`. Below is shown a short summary of `subjects` data frame for the `test` dataset.


```r
subject_test <- read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt") 
short_summary(subject_test)
```

```
Observations: 	 2947 			First variables: V1 
Variables: 	 1 			Last variables: V1

 1st Qu.: 9.00  
 Median :12.00  
 Mean   :12.99  
 3rd Qu.:18.00  
 Max.   :24.00  
```


```

Vector Class: integer
```

```
	Subject IDs: 2 4 9 10 12 13 18 20 24
```
We now can observe that the subject IDs missing values in the `train` dataset appear in the `test` dataset, which is expected according to the rules of the experiment: _The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data._

> Later on, both subjects data frames will be merged with their corresponding measurement data frames, `train` and `test`.


### Activity labels
The activity labels are read from the file `activity_labels.txt`. We show a view of the data frame:


```r
# read activity labels. They are 6 activity label variables
# rows: 6
# V1:   activity ID
# V2:   activity description
# file: "./data/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt"
activity_labels <<- read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
activity_labels
```

```
  V1                 V2
1  1            WALKING
2  2   WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3  3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4  4            SITTING
5  5           STANDING
6  6             LAYING
```
The activity labels are stored in the second column of the data frame. The first column is the ID. This `ID` will be used later to merge this data frame against the measurement data frames `train` and `test`.


```
[1] "WALKING"            "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"   "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
[4] "SITTING"            "STANDING"           "LAYING"            
```



### Activities data frames for `train` and `data`
In the same way as the `Subjects` data frames for `train` and `test` were structured, there are two data frames that will be used to link the activity being performed by the subject on each of the `nrow(train)` and `nrow(test)` observations, respectively. Let's take a look at the data frames:


```r
activity_train <- read.table("./data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt") 
short_summary(activity_train)
```

```
Observations: 	 7352 			First variables: V1 
Variables: 	 1 			Last variables: V1 

First observations
  V1
1  5
2  5
3  5
4  5
5  5
6  5

Summary of selected variables
```

```
       V1       
 Min.   :1.000  
 1st Qu.:2.000  
 Median :4.000  
 Mean   :3.643  
 3rd Qu.:5.000  
 Max.   :6.000  
```
As we can see above, there are 7352 observations in this `activity_train` data frame. They correspond exactly with the number of observations of the `train` measurements data frame.

We can also observe that the activity IDs show 1 id numbers although there are 7352 observations in this data frame.

```r
# uniques ID for the train activity dataframe
sort(unique(activity_train$V1))
```

```
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6
```




# Constructing the data sets for analysis

## Read the variables names

### do all the features are unique

### add a column to mark duplicates

### what are the columns that are repeating


# Transformations

## Dealing with the repeating columns
We find that there are 3 groups of variables:

* fBodyAcc-bandsEnergy
* fBodyAccJerk-bandsEnergy
* fBodyGyro-bandsEnergy

Each of this variables have 42 energy measurements on three different windows (w1, w2, w3), and on three different axis (X, Y, Z). These variables need to be renamed accordingly to avoid repeating name of the columns.

The windows have different resolutions: `w1` has 8 steps bins like this: 1-8, [9, 16], [17, 24], [25, 32], [33, 40], [41, 48], [49, 56] and [56, 64]. `w2` has a 16 steps bins: [1, 16], [17, 32], [33, 48] and [49, 64]. `w3` has a step of 24 bins: [1, 24] and [25, 48]; id doesn't go up to 64.

These three windows (w1, w2, w3) read over the X, Y and Z axis. To differentiate the repeating columns we will have to add the axis to each of the windows.

### find if any column is repeating now

## Assign descriptive names to train data set

## Keep only mean and std-dev variables

## Read activitiy labels

## Read activities dataset

## Read subjects dataset

## Merging datasets
This action has 3 parts:

1. Merging the train_activities table with the activities table (with descriptive names)

2. Merging the joined table above (train_activities_inner) with the train measurments dataset.

3. Merging the subjects table with train table


# Getting the data

## Acquiring the datasets

We start by downloading the zipped file containing all the datasets and associated files.
We load the library `downloader` to allow us the use of the function `download()`.

Since we want to make this analysis reproducible, we added the capability of detecting if the folder `data` exists in the folder structure. If it doesn't exist, the script will create it for the user. Downloading and extracting the files will take few minutes.


```r
library(downloader)

if(!file.exists("./data")){dir.create("./data")}

fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

# download(fileUrl, dest="dataset.zip", mode="wb") 
# unzip ("dataset.zip", exdir = "./data")
```
